# RC5 Algorithm on Custom Single Cycle Processor

This repo has the implementation of key generation, encryption and decryption of RC5 algorithm running on a custom MIPS inspired single cycle processor. 

The processor was designed in VHDL and supports a limited instruction set that doesn't have many of the operations that are needed for RC5 functionality. Assembly tricks are used to overcome this constraint. 

Detailed explanation of the project can be found on the pdf file.
